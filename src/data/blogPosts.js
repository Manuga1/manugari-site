*“Every new beginning comes from some other beginning's end.” — Seneca*
--- 
This is my first blog post. I think it stems from a desire to hold on to that which will soon be lost.

I've always maintained that graduation isn't a happy moment, but a sad one; but now I'm inclined to change my mind.

I've never been the type to dance to parties or get excited when some obscure rap artist releases a new song, always preferring the company of my close friends, instruments, and books to loud music and bright lights. But this last year has been different -- I've tried to hang out with my friends as much as possible, and I've even tried to go to a party or two, just for the experience.

Over the last few months of senior year, time seemed to accelerate without warning. What began as an ordinary ending slowly transformed into a series of moments I didn’t realize I was collecting. I went to Houston with my friends for the FTC Robotics International Championship, a trip defined less by where we were and more by the simple novelty of being together somewhere unfamiliar. I attended FBLA Nationals, surrounded by thousands of people chasing their ambitions , while quietly realizing how close I was to having to chase my ambitions without my friends behind me.

Then there was our senior trip — one final, collective pause on the shore of lake michigan before scattering - where the days blurred into one another. Around a campfire and in the hot tub talked without urgency, laughed without reason, and lived without the constant awareness of what came next. For that brief stretch of time, the future loosened its iron grip on my present.

And now, everyone is leaving.

The people, the routines, the fundamental essence of my life — all of it is dissolving at once. In a matter of weeks, I will begin again at Vanderbilt, surrounded by unfamiliar faces and an unfamiliar version of myself. It feels strange to stand at the edge of something new while still mourning that which has not yet fully ended.

But maybe that is what gives everything its value.

If nothing disappeared, nothing would matter. If moments did not expire, they would never hold our admiration. Perhaps meaning is not found in permanence, but in transience — in the knowledge that time is limited, and therefore sacred.

I don’t think graduation is happy. But I no longer think it is just sad either. It is the quiet recognition that something mattered enough to grieve — and that soon, something new will matter just as deeply.

I’ve found that there are two types of pain.

Physical, and Emotional.

Obviously, these can be further divided – nostalgia, burns, scratches, numbness – but, these are the two that loom large.

At the end of the day, they’re both pain – they are both distressful and bring tears to our eyes, and a desire to never feel such a thing again. But recently, that hasn’t been the case.

While physical pain still brings me the same suffering, I’ve found myself leaning just a little bit more into the one that comes and remains purely within my mind. 

After all, depression is human kind’s magnum opus.

When a family member dies, we mourn. It has no logical basis – in fact the opposite. Animals tend to stay away from the dead; wary of the invisible parasites that could lie within their bodies. The only ‘logical’ reason to stay with the dead is for the starving pup alone, who, impervious to the concept of death, stays by its mother’s cold body, hoping for some food, until it begins to realize the extent of the incredible truth that faces it. 

But humans are different; we mourn, not because we are hopeful for what we stand to gain, but because we are scared of what we stand to lose. We stand to lose our cherished memories, now placed within one mind rather than shared by two. We stand to lose our parents, siblings, friends, and teachers. And despite this valiant effort to somehow ‘honor the dead’ by keeping their memory alive, all we do is hurt ourselves more. 

The pain of seeing a loved one die is seared into our minds for a second time as we see their lifeless body. When we realize we will never see them again every time we look at the inconspicuous clay urn, slowly gathering dust in the corner. When that same feeling makes yet another unwelcome return when we recognize that they cross our mind less and less. We claim that at some point, we find ‘peace,’ but this too is a lie. No, we find equilibrium; a middle ground between the mourning. We learn to live with this sadness. After all, we created this, and the creator always stays close to his creation. 

But no other living organism acts this way – this curse is afflicted upon humans, and humans alone. Perhaps it is this same trait that gives us this fiery drive to make the heavens and ground tremble. Perhaps it is this pain which makes us inherently human. After all, Pain is a human construct.

This is why. Whenever I feel emotional anguish, I remind myself: to be sad is to be alive, and to be sad is to be human. And humanity lies right there; right in that pleasant harmony between not wanting to feel pain, and appreciating the fact that we can feel it at all.

Humans were destined to be sad.

And we were destined to enjoy it.

Happy New Year!

I realize that as of late I haven't been really keeping up with this journal, which is especially tragic considering I've spent the bulk of the last few months doing basically nothing that actually interests me. I'm not sure if my lack of written content is more explicable by my lack of time to write, or my lack of things to write about (though I have a sneaking suspicion it's probably a sad concoction of both of them). However, despite my apparent dissatisfaction with my first semester in college, I think it's still worth sharing, if only so the few of you who read this find some tainted version of a profound truth in what I have to share.

So, without further ado, here is what Maanas's first semester at THE Vanderbilt University (or as Chancellor Diermeier would say it, "VUNDHERBILT!!!") consisted of:

---

## I. Introductions

When leaving for college, I was entirely apathetic. In the moment, I mistook my apparent lack of emotion to mean I was a man of incredible mental fortitude. I would soon realize that this was not the case.

The first couple of days felt incredible. It would be a disservice to the Vanderbilt events planning group to summarize them in just a few sentences, but unfortunately they’ve left me no choice. Some days were completely packed with nearly fourteen hours of activities—around six of which were actually required of all students (but what self-respecting Vanderbilt student would miss even a non-required workshop, right?). There were also evening social activities every single day. I would sometimes meet over one hundred people in a day, and people would desperately claw through crowds trying to meet more people as if their lives depended on it—myself included.

Day six, however, I remember vividly.

I had a snow cone in my hand, filled with some unholy mixture of piña colada, vanilla, strawberry, and God knows what else. It was hour two of standing in the crowd, and a couple of students had started dancing near the center circle around forty-five minutes earlier. I took a spoonful of my snow cone as one of my “old” friends (which is funny, considering I had technically met him only days prior) came up to me and told me—for the fifteenth time that week—that he was about to introduce me to the “coolest person ever.”

Nevertheless, I was inclined to believe him.

From behind him emerged a tall, well-spoken international student with a German accent. He grasped my hand with a firm handshake and, after roughly fifteen seconds of pleasantries, lost interest entirely upon noticing that my watch was not a Hamilton. He then proceeded to have a full conversation with my friend about his own watch collection.

I didn’t know much about watches. I only knew that the one I was wearing had been given to me lovingly by my parents as a birthday gift while I was in India just a month earlier, and that it was the most expensive single piece of clothing or jewelry I had ever owned.

It was at that moment that I began to question my place at this school.

Here were two seemingly average people who, with a single glance, dismissed me—preferring instead to discuss the size of their watch collections, unimpressed by any other value I might have brought to the conversation.

Later that night, I retreated to my dorm room, which quite tragically has a full view of where the gathering was taking place. As I sat there, the words of my high school advisor echoed relentlessly in my head: *big fish, little pond.*

From an intellectual standpoint, I wasn’t worried. I had long since abandoned the idea of “natural intelligence,” preferring the ideology of hard work instead. But I had never realized that her analogy could apply to other aspects of life as well.

One of my defining traits—one I strongly recommend getting rid of if you share it—is an unwillingness to make others worry about me. I refused to call my parents or my friends back home that night. Instead, I unpacked my ukulele (which I had bought in India just weeks earlier) and decided to learn a new song.

That night, I learned how to play *Sparks* by Coldplay.

Over the next month, this pattern continued. I would participate in some social activity—whether a school-sanctioned networking event, a club general body meeting, or even one night singing on Broadway Street—and at the end of each day, something would remind me of the ways in which I was still a “little fish.” Each night, I would pull out my ukulele and learn another song.

Soon, my desperate need to socialize began to take its toll. Grades slipped. Emails went unread. Opportunities passed quietly by.

I was fumbling the most fundamental part of college—the education itself.

Worse still, the people around me were doing the same.

One of my closest friends, who I’ll refer to as *N*, became so inebriated one night that he had to be hospitalized. What shook me most was not the event itself, but the person it happened to. N was the first person I had ever genuinely believed possessed more drive for success than I did.

Though I had personally stayed away from drinking and drugs, something clearly wasn’t working.

Something needed to change—and fast.

---

## II. Lock In

After N recovered, nearly three months of the semester had passed.

By coincidence—or luck—we both had the opportunity to volunteer at a medical camp in his hometown of Cleveland, Tennessee. There, we saw firsthand the staggering contrast between the patients—many struggling with addiction, homelessness, or severe mental illness—and the students we had been surrounding ourselves with back on campus.

That night, lying awake in his house, we talked honestly about our ambitions. We both realized something uncomfortable: wanting success was not enough.

So we made a decision.

We dumbed down our phones. Deleted social media. Removed distractions. We decided to become the people we said we wanted to be.

For the next seventy-five days, we challenged ourselves relentlessly. We studied at least two hours a day. We went to the gym daily. Drank a gallon of water. Read for thirty minutes. We woke up early and went on runs. Slowly, discipline replaced chaos.

For me, as an aspiring MD-PhD, that meant joining a research lab and getting involved in healthcare organizations. For N, it meant joining a pre-tech fraternity and immersing himself in startup initiatives. Later in the semester, the two of us would end up working on one alongside two medical students.

As the weeks passed, the people around me changed. Many from the early social scene faded away, while a small handful remained.

Strangely, I still felt like a small fish—perhaps even smaller than before—but this time, in a good way.

I was no longer intimidated by material things. I was intimidated by work ethic. By effort. By how much others were willing to sacrifice.

That fear pushed me forward.

I spent the remainder of the semester repairing my grades—especially in chemistry and psychology—and working, deliberately, on myself.

And suddenly, we were at the present.

## III. Present Day

Despite everything that happened during my first semester, I’m grateful for what I learned—about myself, and about people.

In high school, I had been in control of nearly everything. I took for granted how painful—but necessary—it can be to be outworked.

Over the last few weeks, I’ve heard the same phrase repeated by countless people: *you only live once.*

That idea has become my guiding principle for second semester.

If the sole purpose of college is to reach some distant graduate program, then perhaps I’ve misunderstood the meaning of success itself.

So this semester, I’ve started trying new things. My passion for programming and creating has been reignited, and I’ve begun working on a startup initiative focused on improving healthcare differential charts. Alongside friends, I’ve helped start a podcast interviewing local healthcare workers. I’ve even been attempting to get Vanderbilt’s first-ever Desi A Cappella group off the ground.

As I continue exploring, I hope I learn how to balance being a pre-MD/PhD student with being a human—one with only a single life and infinitely many experiences to experience.

Don’t worry. Fish have to grow bigger at some point.

I’ll try to continue updating this blog at least once every two weeks—maybe every week. And hopefully, future posts will be more personal.

After all, I won’t have an entire semester’s worth of content to cover next time :)
