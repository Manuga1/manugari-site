I've always maintained that graduation isn't a happy moment, but a sad one; but now I'm inclined to change my mind.  


I've never been the type to dance to parties or get excited when some obscure rap artist releases a new song, always preferring the company of my close friends, instruments, and books to loud music and bright lights. But this last year has been different -- I've tried to hang out with my friends as much as possible, and I've even tried to go to a party or two, just for the experience.
